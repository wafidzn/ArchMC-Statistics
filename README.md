## ArchMC Statistics | Real-Time stats tracker to maximise player engagement

<p>Track your player statistics and activity through our carefully crafted tracker. This utilises the <i>ArchMC Public API</i>, which enables users to extract in-game information and display it on beautiful leaderboards:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Real-time Gamemode leaderboards parsing kills, killstreaks, and KDR from UGC endpoints with rank percentiles.</li>
  <li>Guild directories with name/description search and player-to-guild mapping for network-wide clan intel.</li>
  <li>Economy baltop across all currencies, showing richest players' balances and transaction volumes (made/spent/wagered).</li>
  <li>Player profiles aggregating ELO by kit/queue, lifetime wins, and UGC-specific stats like blocks mined/walked.</li>
</ul>

### Minecraft Server Owners:
<p>Adding a statistics board is a <b>GREAT</b> way to boost player engagement, as it encourages friendly competition, gives players clear goals to work toward, and rewards your most active community members. If you're looking for a custom solution, feel free to contact me (Discord and Portfolio is above). Although this is designed for the ArchMC Community, other server owners may wish to do a similar thing with their server. Just note - you may want to change the design system up since it may feel the same!

### Research, Design & Development:
<p>All assets can be found either in this GitHub Repository or within my Figma Profile. If you're curious as to how I went about building this wonderful project, you can check out the <a href="https://wafidzn.com">Blog Post</a> I made on the project.</p>
<p>Built using NextJS, TailwindCSS & deployed with Vercel.
